# Test Driven Development

1. Unit Testing
2. Component Testing
3. Integration Testing
4. Regression Testing
5. System Testing
   
## White Box Testing
- Tests are developed with knowledge of the source code.
- Written using the same programming language as the API / Code
- Tests the flow / structure of the code

## Black Box Testing

## Black Box Testing
- Test developed based on specification
- Has no knowledge of the underlying code (hence can work on API / LIBS)
- Can be executed by using an end user application

## Grey Box Testing
- A combination of Black / White Box testing
- Testing is implemented with knowledge of internals but using external applications
